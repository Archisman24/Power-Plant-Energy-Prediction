This ML program is designed to develop a predictive model for a Combined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP). This program uses a dataset containing 9568 data points collected over six years when the power plant was operating at full load. The goal of the program is to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of the plant based on various ambient variables.

Dataset Explanation:

The dataset comprises the following features:

Temperature (T): This represents the hourly average ambient temperature.

Ambient Pressure (AP): This denotes the hourly average ambient pressure.

Relative Humidity (RH): This is the hourly average relative humidity of the environment.

Exhaust Vacuum (V): This feature represents the exhaust vacuum, which is collected from and has an effect on the Steam Turbine.

These four ambient variables influence the performance of the Combined Cycle Power Plant. The electricity generation in a CCPP is achieved through a combination of gas turbines (GT) and steam turbines (ST), with heat recovery steam generators playing a role in the process. The electricity is generated by the gas and steam turbines, and energy is transferred from one turbine to another.
